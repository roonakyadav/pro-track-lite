## Security Best Practices

For users of ProTrack Lite:
- Keep your browser and system updated
- Use strong, unique passwords (though the app doesn't require authentication)
- Be cautious when sharing exported data
- Clear localStorage if using shared computers

## Known Security Considerations

Since ProTrack Lite is a client-side only application:
- All data is stored locally in browser storage
- No server-side data transmission occurs
- Be aware of browser security policies and storage limits
- Consider data privacy implications for shared devices
